== New user logs into the insight


1. when the user calls the insight for the first time.
No active user session found in ISAM => Auth level = 0 =>  ISAM calls device authentication service (/unauth/device) - exposed for sessions with AUTH_LEVEL=0

Device authentication service: 
No device id found. new device id is generated with no expiry. Hence the deviceId is valid till the browser session is open.
ISAM creates a new user session and stores the deviceId in it and  and AUTH_LEVEL = 1
send the deviceId / sessionId to the browser 

==========Login page is displayed to the user ==============


2. User enters the emailId and submit.
same device Id / session Id and entered email sent to ISAM.
ISAM validates session and calls Email Authentication service (/auth/email) - exposed for sessions with AUTH_LEVEL=1

EmailAuthentication Service : 
deviceId found in request => decrypt the encrypted ID (done by calling external Ricki API) => 
hash the decrypted Id(done by using Security.MessageDigest and SHA-1 algorithm)
checks if the user is valid. 
set deregistration date for any existing devices for the user  with expirydate > current date 
generate the access key for the given encrypted deviceId by calling GenerateAccessKey service 

GenerateAccessKey service : 
generates new access key
Stores the hashed decrypted device Id in device provision for the first time in DB.
and mails accesskey to the user and send the service response back to ISAM with AUTH_LEVEL=1


===========  access key field is displayed on the login page ============

3. user enters the access key and hits submit.
ISAM validates the deviceId / session ID and calls Access Key validation service - exposed for sessions with AUTH_LEVEL=1

AccessKeyValidation Service : 
validates the access key and loads userProfileata service that internally :
calls the research one entitlement API, loads the dashboards config list  entitlement list and user details 
and sets same in the response. setting the response status = AA0 and Auth_level = 2

Isam validates the response
and redirects to home page of the application => /ui/main/dashboard.
